1. Fix the diagram. Add f and g to the boxes, make the composition structure clear in step 1. Maybe change the output of step 5 to represent the best mapping for image merging thing. (CB)
2. Change the description of step 1, add a sentence of two about how components correspond to functions in the code, and how profiling is done. Mention that host-to-device and device-to-host communication is taken into account in profiling. (VJ)
3. Put the cost model back in. Maybe add some description. (CB)
4. Define throughput, deviation and stuff in MCTS model description (VJ)
5. Explain how GPU workers are modelled. (MG)
6. Mention how expensive each of the steps in the methodology is (VJ).
